Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am Santiago Coelho ([@santicoelho](https://twitter.com/santicoelho) in Twitter), a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R)](https://cai2r.net) of the [NYU Grossman School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/). My work lies at the intersection of physics and computer science with applications on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

My focus is on investigating the advantages of non-standard diffusion MRI sequences for biophysical tissue models. My research interests are in the areas of diffusion in the brain, MRI biophysics, inverse problems, and machine learning for medical image analysis. I regularly contribute to [some repositories from my lab here](https://github.com/NYU-DiffusionMRI), feel free to check them out.
