- Hi, I am @santiagocoelho ([@santicoelho](https://twitter.com/santicoelho) in Twitter).
- I am interested in diffusion MRI physics in general, biophysical modeling, experimental design, and image processing.
- I regularly contribute to [some repositories from my lab here](https://github.com/NYU-DiffusionMRI), feel free to check them out.
